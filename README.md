## Overview
Dive into the streets of a cyberpunk future in **CyberRun**, a simple 2D endless runner developed with the powerful Raylib framework. In this fast-paced adventure, players navigate through a city overrun by surveillance drones, where every second alive pushes the limits of your reflexes and strategy. Your objective is simple yet challenging: survive as long as possible and rack up a high score in a world where the odds are stacked against you.

## Gameplay
**CyberRun** is all about precision, quick reflexes, and strategic movement. Use the **A** and **D** keys to move left or right combined with the **Spacebar** for jumping to dodge the relentless drones that aim to end your run. But be warned: the longer you survive, the faster the world moves, demanding faster reactions and flawless timing.

## Features
- **Endless Runner Mechanics:** A never-ending cyberpunk cityscape filled with drones to test your endurance and skills.
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic:** Thanks to https://craftpix.net/ for the free sprites
- **Scaling Difficulty:** The game dynamically adjusts its speed as you progress, ensuring that the challenge scales with your skill.
- **Simple Controls:** Easy to learn but hard to master, the game uses just three keys (A, D, Space) for intuitive yet engaging gameplay.

## Built With Raylib
**CyberRun** is built using Raylib, a simple and easy-to-use library designed for education and making games from scratch. This was made as part of the GameDevTV's C++ Fundamentals course by taking the second project a couple of steps further.

## How to Play
Clone the repository to your local machine, ensure you have Raylib installed, and compile the game using your preferred C++ compiler.
